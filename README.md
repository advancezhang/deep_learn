Some project about segmentation.The fellow link is use the Paddleseg project，to add the new network at AI Studio platform.

The fellow file is use pytorch frame construct network，can help somebody learn how to create network structure.

At the CNN.py file is about Convolutional Neural Network.It network construct as illustrated in following figure:

At the Unet.py file,it network construct as illustrated in following figure:
